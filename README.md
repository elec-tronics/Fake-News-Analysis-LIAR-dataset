Understanding the persistence of misinformation through embedding-based spectral analysis

Misinformation remains a significant societal challenge, and the advent of tools like ChatGPT has only intensified the issue. This project explores misinformation in textual form through a spectral analysis perspective, aiming to understand why the problem persists despite years of research and numerous proposed solutions.

We apply various embedding techniques to represent information, followed by spectral methods such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The findings highlight that misinformation is deeply intertwined with genuine information, making it difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to effectively separate the two.
